"""The stop boundary must be the last thing on the wire.

When navigation is switched off the node publishes zero wheel speeds, then
acknowledges, then returns success. Nothing may appear on the wheel topic after
that acknowledgment -- an operator who has been told the base is stopped must
not then watch it move.

This is a threading property, not a ROS one, so it is tested without a context:
the two callbacks are driven directly from two threads with the publishers
replaced by recorders. The recorder makes the first wheel publish slow, which
is what opens the interleaving window wide enough to be deterministic rather
than timing-dependent.
